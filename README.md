# SvelteKit Simple TODO App

This app is created using SvelteKit `npx sv create` command, with the Svelte library template is chosen (because I was not sure which one to go for, so decided to go with this, since it helps to setup stuffs like ESLint, Prettier, etc.). `pnpm` is used as the package manager of this simple app.

## Developing

To start the dev server, first install the dependencies (`pnpm install`), then run:

```sh
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```
