# SvelteKit Simple TODO App

This app is created using SvelteKit `npx sv create` command, with the Svelte library template is chosen (because I was not sure which one to go for, so decided to go with this, since it helps to setup stuffs like ESLint, Prettier, etc.). `pnpm` is used as the package manager of this simple app.

## Developing

To start the dev server, first install the dependencies (`pnpm install`), then run:

```sh
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```

## Development Logs

This section is my musing as I develop this app.

### Svelte & SvelteKit

On a glance (and as I suspected all this while), Svelte is kinda similar to Vue (_Still prefer React/JSX style tho_). Thanks to my experience in Next, and some of Vue/Nuxt, I can quickly get the hang of both Svelte and SvelteKit (at a very surface level).
